Guess The Number App
It is an interactive app that generates a random number from 1 to 100 that the user will have to guess to figure out which number was generated.
Features of the app include two buttons, one to submit your guess, and the other button allows you to restart the game during the game or after the correct guess has been chosen. Messages that will display if the user’s guess is higher, lower or is correct and text that displays the number of guesses to get answer.

Design Reason
I went with grey because it’s the same colour as my car, The app has a title that states the name of the app and a subtitle that provides the users with the games guessing range. Below them is the user input box, then the guess button. The range message is below the guess button (Lower, higher, correct) and is followed by the number of guesses and finally the restart game button.

Challenges
Had to do the work by myself – Had a lot of personal things happening so it took most of my focus, so I didn’t make or join a group to be a burden to my teammates, and I was given enough time to complete the ice task, so I didn’t mind doing it myself.

Creating a user input box, if statements and reset – It is much different from pseudocode, so I watched a YouTube video to improve my knowledge on my struggles.

Reflections
I worked by myself so I can’t exactly reflect on group work. If I do work by myself again try to do the work earlier
